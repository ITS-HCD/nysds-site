## Why “TableTop?” 🏔️
When we name our releases, we pick from a list of Adirondack high peaks. For this release, we felt it appropriate to name it after the `<nys-table>` component. TableTop is the 19th highest peak in New York, with an elevation of 4,427 feet (1,349 m)!

## New `<nys-datepicker>` component
The user experience for scheduling appointments, and selecting future dates, can be confusing without a calendar view. The new `<nys-datepicker>` component provides you a way to give users a quick calendar view of dates. **Importantly**, do not use this for “memorable dates” such as “date of birth” or “anniversary date,” instead use a textinput for entering the date manually. [Read the datepicker documentation](/components/datepicker/).

{% set preview %}
<nys-datepicker></nys-datepicker>
{% endset %}
{% set code = preview%}
{% set showTip = false %}
{% set backgroundSolid = true %}
{% include "partials/code-preview.njk" %}

## New `<nys-table>` component
Tables are very useful for displaying structured data on the web. The new `<nys-table>` component aims to standardize the look, feel, and functionality of a table element. You'll find features such as zebra striping, column sorting, and more. [Read the table documentation](/components/table/)

{% set preview %}
<nys-table id="table3" name="table3" bordered sortable striped>
  <table>
    <caption>
    New York State High Peaks and Popular Hikes
    </caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Mountain</th>
        <th>Peak Height (ft)</th>
        <th>Hike Name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Marcy</td>
        <td>5,344</td>
        <td>Van Hoevenberg Trail</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Algonquin</td>
        <td>5,114</td>
        <td>Northeast Trail</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>4,960</td>

      <tr>

        <td>4,926</td>
        <td>Lake Tear Trail</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Whiteface</td>
        <td>4,867</td>
        <td>Whiteface Mountain Trail</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</nys-table>
{% endset %}
{% set code = preview%}
{% set showTip = false %}
{% set backgroundSolid = true %}
{% include "partials/code-preview.njk" %}

## “User Actions” in `<nys-globalheader>`
Based on community feedback, we identified a need to allow engineers to add a “user” menu to the global header. The `<nys-globalheader>` component includes a named slot called `user-actions`. This slot allows you to insert custom HTML content, such as user profile links, settings, or logout buttons, into the header. [Read the user actions documentation](/components/globalheader/#user-actions)

{% set preview %}
<nys-globalheader 
  appName="User Registration Form" 
  agencyName="Office of Information Technology Services"
>
  <nys-button slot="user-actions" label="Sign out" prefixIcon="slotted">
    <nys-avatar
      slot="prefix-icon"
      ariaLabel="User avatar"
      initials="NY"
    ></nys-avatar>
  </nys-button>
</nys-globalheader>
{% endset %}
{% set code = preview%}
{% set showTip = false %}
{% set backgroundSolid = true %}
{% include "partials/code-preview.njk" %}

## Figma updates
Today we’re launching the official versions of our new table and datepicker components in our design library. 
  - **Table** - The table component is ready to use in your Figma designs.
  - **Datepicker** - The datepicker component is ready to use in your Figma designs, too!

[Kristin Sorrentino](https://github.com/ksorrentino) updated these important components!

## Bug fixes
  - Fixed some heading tokens to align with Figma library
  - `<nys-select>` now has a default height applied
  - `<nys-select>` now has a proper disabled state color applied
  - `<nys-table>` has a default filled background color now
  - Clicking the description on an `<nys-checkbox>` or `<nys-radiobutton>` now properly selects the element
  - Many JSDoc updates for better Custom Element Manifest integration

[Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik) and [Robert Chen](https://github.com/novacat35) fix broken things.
