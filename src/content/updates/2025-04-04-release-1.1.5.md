## Figma Code Connect everywhere
All components now have Figma Code Connect wired up, making it easier for designers and engineers to stay in sync, and setting the stage for future design-to-code automation.  
↳ Big thanks to [Jesse Gardner](https://github.com/plasticmind).  

## A leaner npm package
We cut the npm package size nearly in half: faster installs, lighter downloads, and a more performant user experience. Download it today: [NYS Design System on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/nysds)  
↳ Also brought to you by [Jesse Gardner](https://github.com/plasticmind).
