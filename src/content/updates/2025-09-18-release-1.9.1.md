## Divide up your content
The `<nys-divider>` component visually separates content or sections within an interface. For more information, [read the full documentation for the `<nys-divider>`](/components/divider).

{% block example %}
  {% set preview %}
  <h4>Hello World</h4>
<nys-divider></nys-divider>
<h4>Goodbye World</h4>
  {% endset %}
  {% set code = preview%}
  {% set showTip = false %}
  {% include "partials/code-preview.njk" %}
{% endblock %}

## Analyze and resolve Lit warnings
We use Lit.dev as the base of our web components. We have enabled a development-time scanning of Lit templates to ensure we're coding with best practices. We resolved most of those Lit warnings in this release

[Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik) fixed em!

## CSS variables clean-up
We cleaned up some CSS variables and published the remaining public variables.

[Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik) organized the chaos.
