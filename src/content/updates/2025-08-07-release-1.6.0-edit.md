## Phone fields just got smarter
Typing a phone number now auto-formats as you type in `<nys-textinput type="tel">`.

Nice work by [Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik)!

## Fresh icons for better wayfinding
New additions: `mail`, `link`, `arrow_forward`, `arrow_upward`, and `arrow_downward`.  

Thanks to [Robert Chen](https://github.com/novacat35) for keeping our icon set sharp.

## Figma-only updates (engineers, youâ€™re off the hook)

- Global Header was redesigned: better interaction, active menu states  
    â†’ ðŸš¨ Designers: the old version is deprecated, please swap in the new one!
- Screen template is now a published utility component. A ready-to-go starter screen for Figma â€” complete with header, footer, grid, and responsive layout settings.  
    â†’ Designers: drop it in, pick a screen size, and start building.
- Visual updates to fidelity modes and input masks

Thatâ€™s it!
