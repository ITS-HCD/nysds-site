## First-class form elements
Custom NYS Design System form elements now participate in standard HTML forms just like standard HTML elements, thanks to `elementInternals`. This means form-based web components behave the way native form elements should, with values, validation, and accessibility. More information about the `elementInternals` interface can be found on [MDN Web Docs →](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals)  
↳ Big collaborative effort between [Robert Chen](https://github.com/novacat35) and [Jesse Gardner](https://github.com/plasticmind)

## Code Connect = less drift
Parity is here between Figma and code! With Code Connect, designers and developers can finally use the same source of truth, whether in design or development.

- Global header and footer fixes
