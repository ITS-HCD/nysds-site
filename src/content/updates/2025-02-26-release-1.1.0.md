# Release Notes

We've made bug fixes since our last release and are happy to share the **1.1.0 release** of NYSDS. You can explore and install our published packages here: [NYS Design System on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/nysds).

We did not add any new components in this release, but this we've added native form element functionality to NYSDS form-based web components and have fixed a lot of bugs.

## What's New 

### ‚ú® Form elements properly reflect values and validation 

- `elementInternals` is now used on all form elements to properly reflect properties and values  [#326](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/326) [#334](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/334) [#348](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/348) [#347](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/347) [#352](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/352) [#319](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/319) [#317](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/317) [#315](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/315)
