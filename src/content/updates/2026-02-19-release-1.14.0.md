## Why “Marcy?” 🏔️
Mount Marcy is huge. This release is a huge milestone for us too. This is our [one year anniversary]() of the 1.0 release of the NYS Design System, so we figured we'd go with the biggest mountain around! Marcy is the highest peak in New York, with an elevation of 5,343.1 ft (1628.6 m)!

## New approach to agency themes
New agency theme files have been added back to the `@nysds/styles` package. They are no longer minified so they are easier to read. To get the new agency themes to work, you'll need to either link to the separate file, or add a data-theme attribute to your body or HTML tags.

<nys-datepicker></nys-datepicker>
{% endset %}
{% set code = preview%}
{% set showTip = false %}
{% set backgroundSolid = true %}
{% include "partials/code-preview.njk" %}

## New `<nys-table>` component
Tables are very useful for displaying structured data on the web. The new `<nys-table>` component aims to standardize the look, feel, and functionality of a table element. You'll find features such as zebra striping, column sorting, and more. [Read the table documentation](/components/table/)

{% set preview %}
<nys-table id="table3" name="table3" bordered sortable striped>
  <table>
    <caption>
    New York State High Peaks and Popular Hikes
    </caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Mountain</th>
        <th>Peak Height (ft)</th>
        <th>Hike Name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Marcy</td>
        <td>5,344</td>
        <td>Van Hoevenberg Trail</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Algonquin</td>
        <td>5,114</td>
        <td>Northeast Trail</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Haystack</td>
        <td>4,960</td>
        <td>Johns Brook Trail</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Skylight</td>
        <td>4,926</td>
        <td>Lake Tear Trail</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Whiteface</td>
        <td>4,867</td>
        <td>Whiteface Mountain Trail</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</nys-table>
{% endset %}
{% set code = preview%}

{% set backgroundSolid = true %}
{% include "partials/code-preview.njk" %}

## “User Actions” in `<nys-globalheader>`
Based on community feedback, we identified a need to allow engineers to add a “user” menu to the global header. The `<nys-globalheader>` component includes a named slot called `user-actions`. This slot allows you to insert custom HTML content, such as user profile links, settings, or logout buttons, into the header. [Read the user actions documentation](/components/globalheader/#user-actions)

{% set preview %}
<nys-globalheader 
  appName="User Registration Form" 
  agencyName="Office of Information Technology Services"
>
  <nys-button slot="user-actions" label="Sign out" prefixIcon="slotted">
    <nys-avatar
      slot="prefix-icon"
      ariaLabel="User avatar"
      initials="NY"
    ></nys-avatar>
  </nys-button>
</nys-globalheader>
{% endset %}
{% set code = preview%}
{% set showTip = false %}
{% set backgroundSolid = true %}
{% include "partials/code-preview.njk" %}

## Figma updates
Today we’re launching the official versions of our new table and datepicker components in our design library. 
  - **Table** - The table component is ready to use in your Figma designs.
  - **Datepicker** - The datepicker component is ready to use in your Figma designs, too!

[Kristin Sorrentino](https://github.com/ksorrentino) updated these important components!

## Bug fixes
  - Fixed some heading tokens to align with Figma library
  - `<nys-select>` now has a default height applied
  - `<nys-select>` now has a proper disabled state color applied
  - `<nys-table>` has a default filled background color now
  - Clicking the description on an `<nys-checkbox>` or `<nys-radiobutton>` now properly selects the element
  - Many JSDoc updates for better Custom Element Manifest integration

[Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik) and [Robert Chen](https://github.com/novacat35) fix broken things.
