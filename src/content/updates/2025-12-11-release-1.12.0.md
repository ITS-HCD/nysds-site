## Why “Skylight?” 🏔️

When we name our releases, we pick from a list of Adirondack high peaks.  We held a vote in our teams channel and after 34 total responses, our winner is **Skylight** with 17 votes! Skylight is the fourth-highest peak in New York, with an elevation of 4,924 feet (1,501 m)!

## Hello new tooltip!
<nys-alert type="warning" heading="WARNING" text="The old tooltip wrapper has been removed from the package as of 1.12.0. If you are using it, please update your code to use the new standalone tooltip component." primaryLabel="Documentation for new standalone tooltip component" primaryAction="/components/tooltip"></nys-alert>

We realized soon after releasing the `<nys-tooltip>` component that is was too limited in scope. It was only able to be wrapped around buttons and icons. So we took a look at other design systems and decided to implement tooltip as a stand-alone component. Using a `for` attribute to target an `id` will display tooltips on the following elements:

  - `<nys-button>`
  - `<nys-icon>`
  - `<nys-textinput>` (appears as a hint icon)
  - `<nys-textarea>` (appears as a hint icon)
  - `<nys-select>` (appears as a hint icon)
  - `<nys-checkboxgroup>` (appears as a hint icon)
  - `<nys-checkbox>` (appears as a hint icon)
  - `<nys-radiogroup>` (appears as a hint icon)
  - `<nys-fileinput>` (appears as a hint icon)

### Tooltip demo
{% set preview %}
<nys-tooltip for="my-textinput" text="I am a tooltip."></nys-tooltip>
<nys-textinput id="my-textinput" name='fullName' label="Full name" description="Enter your full legal name" width="md"></nys-textinput>
{% endset %}
{% set code = preview%}
{% set showTip = false %}
{% set backgroundSolid = true %}
{% include "partials/code-preview.njk" %}

[Robert Chen](https://github.com/novacat35) was tipped off about this change.

## New responsive utility classes
We have added new responsive variants for our popular utility classes. You can now apply certain utility classes at specific breakpoints as written below:

{% set code %}
<div class="nys-grid-row">
<div class="nys-grid-col-12 nys-tablet:nys-grid-col-6 nys-desktop:nys-grid-col-4">12 columns at mobile size.</div>
<div class="nys-grid-col-12 nys-tablet:nys-grid-col-6 nys-desktop:nys-grid-col-4">6 columns at tablet size.</div>
<div class="nys-grid-col-12 nys-tablet:nys-grid-col-6 nys-desktop:nys-grid-col-4">4 columns at desktop size.</div>
</div>
{% endset %}
{% set preview %}
<div class="nys-grid-row">
<div class="nys-grid-col-12 nys-tablet:nys-grid-col-6 nys-desktop:nys-grid-col-4" style="border-width: var(--nys-border-width-md); border-style: dashed; text-align: center;">12 columns at mobile size</div>
<div class="nys-grid-col-12 nys-tablet:nys-grid-col-6 nys-desktop:nys-grid-col-4" style="border-width: var(--nys-border-width-md); border-style: dashed; text-align: center;">6 columns at tablet size</div>
<div class="nys-grid-col-12 nys-tablet:nys-grid-col-6 nys-desktop:nys-grid-col-4" style="border-width: var(--nys-border-width-md); border-style: dashed; text-align: center;">4 columns at desktop size</div>
</div>
{% endset %}
{% set showTip = false %}
{% set backgroundSolid = true %}
{% include "partials/code-preview.njk" %}

## Figma updates
  - **Table** - The table component is ready to use in your Figma designs!
  - **Datepicker** - The datepicker component is ready to use in your Figma designs, too!

[Leo Vogel](https://github.com/leo-vogel) and [Kristin Sorrentino](https://github.com/ksorrentino) rose to the challenge!

## Updates to Custom Element Manifest (CEM)
  - Added missing events to several components including `<nys-textinput>`, `<nys-textarea>`, and `<nys-select>`.
  - Improved descriptions and typings for various properties and methods across multiple components.
  - VSCode intellisense now properly reports back options for properties like `size` in `<nys-icon>` and `width` in `<nys-button>`.

[Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik) insisted on improving intellisense.


## 🚨 Breaking changes
