# Release Notes

We've made a lot of progress since our last release and are happy to share the **1.0.0 release** of the component library and design libraries. You can explore and install our published packages here: [NYS Design System on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/nysds).

We added 3 new components: `<nys-button>`, `<nys-unavheader>`, and `<nys-unavfooter>`‚Äî bringing us to 17 web components in total, more than the 15 we slated for 1.0.0. Review [our developer Storybook](https://its-hcd.github.io/nysds/?path=/docs/components-unavfooter--docs) for updated documentation on the new components.

I want to give a big shout out to the Design System team. They've been working tirelessly for the last 3 months and have accomplished a great deal in that short time. Thank you¬†Eric,¬†Doug,¬†Emily,¬†Leo,¬†Kristin, and¬†Robert!

## What's New 

### ‚ú® New `<nys-unavheader>` and `<nys-unavfooter>` Component: `[@nysds](https://github.com/nysds)/nys-unavheader` `[@nysds](https://github.com/nysds)/nys-unavfooter`

- A component to create a Universal header in sites and apps [#271](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/271)
- A component to create a Universal Footer in sites and apps [#259](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/259)
- [Figma nys-unavheader component design reference](https://www.figma.com/design/0ogYpymUPQQfhELthntNbt/%F0%9F%92%A0-NYSDS-%2F-Components?node-id=1616-6759&t=wCig8fhbifh6ryK0-1)
- [Figma nys-unavfooter component design reference](https://www.figma.com/design/0ogYpymUPQQfhELthntNbt/%F0%9F%92%A0-NYSDS-%2F-Components?node-id=3568-16435&t=wCig8fhbifh6ryK0-1)

**Note:** the official [Universal Navigation script embed](https://github.com/ITS-HCD/unav-next) should still be used on most sites. This version of the component was created to make it easier for application teams that ran into JS conflict issues with the official embed version.

### üõ† Maintenance and Fixes

- Form fields should now bubble up their values in Angular and React-based applications.
- Many updates were made to various elements with no breaking changes.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

-  While our custom form components can be used with frameworks that have form helpers (like Angular), native <form> elements won't submit their value. We have a fix for that coming in the next release.
- Some of the max-width of header elements are out of alignment with the grid utilities. That will be addressed in the next release.
- If you notice any other issues, please add them to [our GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ITS-HCD/nysds/issues).

### Design Libraries (Figma):

- We published the full suite of 1.0.0 components. Review them in the [NYS Design System Components Figma Library](https://www.figma.com/design/0ogYpymUPQQfhELthntNbt/%F0%9F%92%A0-NYSDS-%2F-Components?node-id=20-40&t=wCig8fhbifh6ryK0-1).
- We added [a helpful "Getting Started" section](https://www.figma.com/design/0ogYpymUPQQfhELthntNbt/%F0%9F%92%A0-NYSDS-%2F-Components?node-id=7598-2784&t=wCig8fhbifh6ryK0-1) that walks through core concepts for the components library and how you can use it to design and build prototypes.
