<!-- SPOOKY RELEASE!!! üëª -->
## Why ‚ÄúGothic‚Äù

When we name our releases, we pick from a list of Adirondack high peaks. This week's release is named **Gothic**. We wanted to take advantage of spooky season and find an appropriate name! BOO! üëª

## `<nys-option>` deprecated
`<nys-select>` has been updated to use ‚Äúnative guts.‚Äù **If you are running v1.11.0 or higher, you should use native `<option>` and `<optgroup>` tags instead of `<nys-option>`.** Check it out below and on the [`<nys-select>` documentation page](/components/select).

<nys-alert
  type="warning"
  heading="WARNING: Installations prior to v1.11.0 should continue to use `<nys-option>`">
</nys-alert>
