<!-- SPOOKY RELEASE!!! üëª -->
## Why ‚ÄúGothics?‚Äù

When we name our releases, we pick from a list of Adirondack high peaks. This week's release is named **Gothics**. We wanted to take advantage of spooky season and find an appropriate name! BOO! üëª

## `<nys-option>` deprecated
`<nys-select>` has been updated to use ‚Äúnative guts.‚Äù **If you are running v1.11.0 or higher, you should use native `<option>` and `<optgroup>` tags instead of `<nys-option>`.** Check it out below and on the [`<nys-select>` documentation page](/components/select).

## `nys-icon` size ramp change
`<nys-icon>` sizes synced between design and code - [Read the icon size documentation](/components/icon/#size). 
This release includes **major changes** to the icon size system to align with new design tokens and improve consistency between Figma and code.  

**Relative size updates:**
- Added: `5xl`
- Removed: `2xs`
- `md` is now the **default** size (previously `sm`)
- The size ramp has been shifted up, so if you have been using relative sizes, your icons may be smaller

**Literal size updates:**
- Added: `14`, `18`, `20`, `40`, `50`
- Removed: `48`, `64`
