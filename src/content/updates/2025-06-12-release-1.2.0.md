## Automated testing kicks in
You won't see it, but this is a big deal. `<nys-icon>` and `<nys-textarea>` now have automated tests running in CI. If a test fails, the build fails, which makes it easier for us to catch bugs before publishing releases.  

↳ Thanks to [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35) for putting testing in place.  

## Other fixes and improvements
- Updated our list of [design tokens](https://designsystem.ny.gov/foundations/design-tokens)
- Translate button in `nys-unavheader` works properly now, and the logo link doesn't open in a new tab anymore
- Improved documentation for component events in our documentation
- Fixed the nys-avatar slot

↳ Fixes by [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35) and [Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik).  

## Figma gets some love
Designers, you’ve got some lovely new tools in your Figma:  
- A circle button prop for `nys-button` (Figma-only for now)  
- Subcomponents for `nys-label` and `nys-error` to make it easier to build your own custom input types  
- The `nys-unavheader` logo alignment is better

↳ Thanks to [Kristin Sorrentino](https://github.com/ksorrentino) and [Leo Vogel](https://github.com/leo-vogel) for sweating the small stuff.
