# ★ NYSDS v.1.2.0

Excited to release the New York State Design System 1.1.10 today! We have spent this sprint catching up on component designs in Figma, and fixing bugs in components. We are following a new QA process for all new components. We have 3 components in the engineering queue and will be releasing them soon!

### 🖌️ Figma Library Updates
 - New Circle Button variant of nys-button (Figma only, no code yet)
 - Input subcomponents for nys-label and nys-error for use by designers in building custom input types
 - unav header NYS logo fixed

### 🧰 NEW Tests for NYSDS components
 - Tests have been created for these components this release:
	 - nys-icon
	 - nys-textarea
- These tests are automated during development and are implemented to be tested on CI pipelines and will fail a build if they fail a test
