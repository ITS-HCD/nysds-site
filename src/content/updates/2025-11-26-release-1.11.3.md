## NYS Design System Figma file now publically available
Check out our newly released Figma file for the New York State Design System. You can use all of the components in the system, use the project template, and so much more. Use the [NYS Design System Figma file today](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1574803287825265318).

[Leo Vogel](https://github.com/novacat35) and [Kristin Sorrentino](https://github.com/ksorrentino) live for the publicity.

## Sass under the hood
Our initial setup for the NYS Design System included raw CSS file imports through JavaScript. We have run out of runway with vanilla CSS and have made the conversion to Sass for all style files. Sass gives us more flexibility in generating CSS programatically. All components have been converted to use Sass, and an added benefit, the file size for the package was reduced by 40KB just by including minified CSS instead of expanded. Stay tuned for an extensive utility class expansion coming soon!

[Eric Steinborn](https://github.com/esteinborn) ended up getting real sassy.
