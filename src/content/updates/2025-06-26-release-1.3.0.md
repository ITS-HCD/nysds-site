# ‚òÖ NYSDS v.1.3.0

Excited to release the New York State Design System 1.3.0 today! We have spent this sprint consolidating our Figma libraries to enable new features like wireframing modes. We shipped 2 new components, `<nys-button circle>` and `<nys-backtotop>` and fixed a few bugs. We're working hard on the next set of components: `<nys-tooltip>`, `<nys-fileinput>`, and more!
