## Figma libraries streamlined
Designers, this one’s for you. We merged the Components and Foundations library, which makes them easier to use with branching and will be a better experience when we publish to the community. This also sets the stage for powerful new “modes” (like wireframing)... coming soon.

And good news: `<nys-tooltip>` has already landed in Figma, and will be available in code soon!

↳ Thanks to [Kristin Sorrentino](https://github.com/ksorrentino) and [Leo Vogel](https://github.com/leo-vogel) for the tireless work in making this happen.  

## Back to Top joins the library
Need a quick way back to the top of a page? `<nys-backtotop>` is here! Put it at the bottom of your main content container, and it will appear once the user scrolls down. Read more about it on [the nys-backtotop component documentation page](https://designsystem.ny.gov/components/backtotop).

## Circle button variant
`<nys-button>` now has a circle variant, great for icon-only actions. (Be sure to use the `label` prop for accessibility!)

## Lots of other fixes and improvements

- ☑️ Checkbox tiles are now fully clickable 
- Button height issues resolved (no more overflow or static sizing)  
- Password toggle button no longer overlaps input text
- Browser support information added to Storybook and the Reference site  

↳ Thanks to [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35), [Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik), and [Jesse Gardner](https://github.com/plasticmind) for sweating the details.
