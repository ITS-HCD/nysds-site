# Release Notes

Weâ€™re excited to announce that Excelsior is now available for use! You can explore and install our published packages here: [NYS Excelsior on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/nys-excelsior). This release includes all previous components and some modifications to theming â€” We have also shipped our `[@nys-excelsior](https://github.com/nys-excelsior)/styles` package to style the components and make design tokens available for broader use.

## What's New 

### âœ¨ Updated Style Package: `[@nys-excelsior](https://github.com/nys-excelsior)/styles`

- A centralized CSS file for core design tokens `(excelsior.min.css)`
- Agency-specific theme stylesheets (e.g., `excelsior-theme-health.min.css`, `excelsior-theme-environment.min.css`) that can override the components and UI elements using themed variables
- Utility classes that cover common styling needs for grid layout, display styles, flexbox, floats, opacity, and z-index (`excelsior-full.min.css`) [#179](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/179) [#189](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/189)
- Integration support for the design systemâ€™s code components, which will reference these variables in their Shadow DOM
- Typography variables and classes added to the styles package [#208](https://github.com/its-hcd/nysds/issues/208)

This CSS framework will help us get consistent theming and styling across all New York State digital products.
