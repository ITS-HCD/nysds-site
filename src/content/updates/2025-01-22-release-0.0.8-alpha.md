## Styles now have their own home  

Big news: [`@nysds/styles`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nysds/styles) has officially joined the family. It brings:  
- A centralized CSS file for core design tokens
- Agency-specific themes (like Health and Environment)  
- [Utility classes](https://designsystem.ny.gov/foundations/utilities) for layout grid, flexbox, display, margin/padding, typography, and more
- Full integration with code components, so tokens flow straight into the Shadow DOM  

This was a huge step in making NYS digital products look and feel consistent everywhere.

## Documentation revamp

The team gave component docs a full refresh. Clearer, easier, faster to navigate, so you can spend less time hunting and more time building.  
↳ Updated by Emily Gorelik ([@emilygorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik)) and Robert Chen ([@novacat35](https://github.com/novacat35))
