# Release Notes

Weâ€™re excited to announce that Excelsior is now live on NPM! ðŸŽ‰ You can explore and install our published packages here: [NYS Excelsior on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/nys-excelsior). This release includes two new componentsâ€”`<nys-textarea>` and `<nys-toggle>`â€”and significant improvements to our build and publishing workflows.

## What's New 

### New Component: nys-textarea

Description: UI element for entering multiline text input.

Features:

- Height adjusts automatically based on content or can be set manually via the `rows` property
- Supports max length (specify a maximum number of characters)
- Supports a label and a description, with a label positioned at the top of the input and optional description text beneath it. (This is a standard pattern for input elements across the design system.)
- Includes validation support, like required fields, regex patterns, and more to match form requirements

### New Component: nys-toggle

Description: Toggle switch for binary options (on/off). Recommended for cases where the action is binary, such as enabling/disabling settings, but `nys-checkbox` is preferred for more complex selections.

Features:

- Includes small (`sm`) and medium (`md`, default) sizes. Font sizes and spacing adjust accordingly.
- Description can be set either via the `description` property or a slot
- Icons help improve the understandability of the toggle, but can be disable with `NoIcons` boolean property
- Use the`form` attribute to associate toggle with a `<form>` for submission handling
- Includes ARIA roles and supports keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and visual focus indicators
- Emits standard `change`, `focus`, `blur`, and `keydown` events
