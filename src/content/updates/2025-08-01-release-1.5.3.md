## Forms behave again
Text Input no longer overflows its container — forms are back to being predictable and easy to use.  
↳ Big thanks to [Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik) for tracking this down.  

## A more accessible UNavheader
Tab order inside `nys-unavheader` has been corrected, so moving through links with the keyboard now works as expected.  
↳ Kudos to [Eric Steinborn](https://github.com/esteinborn) for pushing this fix through.  

## Back to Top works as expected
The `nys-backtotop` button no longer shows up in the wrong place, and its events now use the proper `nys-` prefix.  
↳ Shout out to [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35) for handling this one.  

## Other fixes and improvements
- `nys-tooltip` now render correctly on icons  
- Avatar now uses `ariaLabel` for accessibility  
- Transparent backgrounds in `nys-fileinput` lists fixed  
- Business agency group ramp color corrected  
- Dependency linking and publishing workflow bugs squashed  
- Code Connect enhancements for `nys-backtotop` and circle prop for `nys-button`
