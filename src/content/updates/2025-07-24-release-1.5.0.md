## Welcome, tooltips!
`<nys-tooltip>` has officially joined the design system family. Wrap it around a `<nys-button>` or `<nys-icon>` and you’ll get clear, accessible context on hover or focus.  
↳ Built with care by [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35).  

## File Input, all cleaned up
We gave `<nys-fileinput>` some extra attention this round. With the bugs ironed out, it’s ready to handle uploads reliably in production.  
↳ Fixes led by [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35).  

## Other fixes and improvements
- Proper UMD builds for alpha releases  
- `ariaLabel` support added to `nys-icon`  
- `nys-unavheader` accessibility improved: search button labeled and aria values corrected  
- Logic fix for `validateFileHeader`  

↳ Thanks to [Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik), [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35), and [Eric Steinborn](https://github.com/esteinborn) for their work across these updates.
