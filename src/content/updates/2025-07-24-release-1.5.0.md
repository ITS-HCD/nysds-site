## ‚òÖ NYSDS v.1.5.0

Happy New York State Design System 1.5.0! We are releasing multiple fixes to our `<nys-fileinput>` component. We're also releasing a new `nys-tooltip` component. We also fixed a few bugs.

### üí† New Component
#### `<nys-tooltip>`
Tooltip has come out of design into code this release. Wrap `<nys-button>` and `<nys-icon>` with a `<nys-tooltip>` to create a tooltip on a button or an icon:
