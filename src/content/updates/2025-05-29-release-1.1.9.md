## Testing takes center stage
Seven components, including `<nys-globalheader>`, `<nys-globalfooter>`, `<nys-button>`, `<nys-alert>`, and `<nys-textinput>`, now run automated tests in CI. This means more reliable builds and fewer surprises in production.  

↳ Thanks for all the hard work from [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35) and [Eric Steinborn](https://github.com/esteinborn) to make this a reality.


## Smarter forms, stronger inputs
Forms get a big boost this release:  

A **tile variant** for `<nys-checkbox>` and `<nys-radiobutton>` makes grouped choices clearer and easier to scan.

`<nys-textinput>` has two new variants: an **input with button** (great for search bars) and a **password field** with a show/hide toggle.

↳ Thanks to [Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik) and [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35) for building out these updates.  

## “Copy that!”
The `<nys-icon>` now includes a **copy icon**.

## Cleaner example code
Example blocks on the reference site have a new format and layout, making it easier to grab and reuse snippets.
