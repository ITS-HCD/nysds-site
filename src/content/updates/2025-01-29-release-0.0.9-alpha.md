This release introduces the new Global Header and Footer components, improves form elements, and updates core dependencies.  
↳ Thanks to Robert Chen ([@NovaCat35](https://github.com/NovaCat35)), Emily Gorelik ([@emilygorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik)), Jesse Gardner ([@plasticmind](https://github.com/plasticmind)), and Eric Steinborn ([@esteinborn](https://github.com/esteinborn)) for the collaborative effort.

## New Components: Global Header + Global Footer  
The biggest addition this release:  
- **Global Header (`nys-globalheader`)** standardizes top navigation across apps and sites.  
- **Global Footer (`nys-globalfooter`)** ensures consistency at the bottom of every page.  
- Both respect agency-specific themes for seamless branding.  
↳ Created by [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35) and [Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik)

## Maintenance and Fixes  
- **Forms behave better:** `nys-select`, `nys-textinput`, and `nys-textarea` now properly bubble change/input events. `nys-textarea` also adds `select` and `selectionchange` events.  
- **Dependencies updated:** Vite patched for vulnerabilities, Storybook upgraded to 8.5.2.
