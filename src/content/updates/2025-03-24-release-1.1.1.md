## Fresh tokens, fresh vibes
Figma variables and design tokens in code have been brought up to date, making things more consistent across design and engineering.  

↳ Thanks to [Robert Chen](https://github.com/novacat35) and [Leo Vogel](https://github.com/leo-vogel) for leading the charge.  

## Bug fixes galore
We squashed a whole batch of issues across multiple components — no breaking changes, just smoother sailing all around.  

↳ Fixes delivered by [Robert Chen](https://github.com/novacat35), [Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik), [Eric Steinborn](https://github.com/esteinborn), [Jesse Gardner](https://github.com/plasticmind), and [Leo Vogel](https://github.com/leo-vogel).
