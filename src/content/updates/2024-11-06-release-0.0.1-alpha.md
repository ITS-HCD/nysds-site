## Ever Upward!

Today marks a huge milestone: the very first **alpha release** of the Excelsior Design System (early codename)! This release lays the foundation for everything that will come afterâ€”our build process, our standards, and the collaborative spirit of the team.  

Big thanks to [Jesse Gardner](https://github.com/plasticmind) for laying down so much of the early groundwork, and to the whole ITS HCD team for helping bring Excelsior to life. This is just the beginning.  

## Project Foundations  

- Added a **pull request template** to keep our contributions clear and consistent ([#25](https://github.com/ITS-HCD/excelsior/pull/25))  
- Configured **TypeScript (tsconfig)** to standardize our dev environment ([#26](https://github.com/ITS-HCD/excelsior/pull/26))  
- Introduced **Rollup bundling** with plugins to streamline packaging ([#28](https://github.com/ITS-HCD/excelsior/pull/28))  
- Set up **ESLint + linting tasks** to keep our codebase clean and maintainable ([#30](https://github.com/ITS-HCD/excelsior/pull/30))  
- Integrated **Vite and Storybook** for lightning-fast development and interactive component previews ([#45](https://github.com/ITS-HCD/excelsior/pull/45))  

These building blocks are the core of our workflowâ€”and theyâ€™ll help us ship stable, consistent, and accessible components going forward.
