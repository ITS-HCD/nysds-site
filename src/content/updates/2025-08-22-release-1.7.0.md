## Weird Al Yankovic would be proud
Add collapsible sections to your content with [the new `nys-accordion` component](/components/accordion). You can create a one-off accordion, or group a set together.

## Show us your badges
[The new `nys-badge` component](/components/badge) is a rounded, styled text label which can be used to display categories, tags, or other non-interactable labels for content. You can see examples of the nys-badge at the top of each page.
