# 1.1.6 NYSDS Release Notes  
â˜… NYSDS v.1.1.6

This release fixes an accessibility bug in the button component and fixes a regression in 1.1.5 that caused it to break when trying to build.

- **Undefined components will be invisible until after they have been defined by Javascript:** Previously, components would show an unstyled layout before the Javascript loaded the custom element. Now it waits until the javascript has defined the element before displaying it.
Fixed by Emily Gorelik ([@emilygorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik))
- **Button needs an accessible name:** The button element was not properly defining a label for screen readers. This bug was fixed. 
Fixed by Robert Chen ([@novacat35](https://github.com/novacat35))
- **NPM install fix:** A bug was discovered in the NPM package which caused it to fail installing. A fix was made to the NPM package to adress the failing installs. Installs should complete successfully on version 1.1.6.
