## Components load more gracefully
Undefined components no longer flash unstyled layouts before JavaScript kicks in — they now wait until they’re fully defined before displaying.  
↳ Fix by [Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik).  

## Buttons get their voice back
`nys-button` now properly define an accessible name for screen readers, ensuring smoother navigation and better accessibility.  
↳ Thanks to [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35).  

## NPM install issues resolved
A packaging bug introduced in 1.1.5 caused installs to fail. That’s now fixed — installs should work smoothly on v1.1.6.  
↳ Patch by [Eric Steinborn](https://github.com/esteinborn).
