## Notable bug fixes
 - `<nys-fileinput>` used to double click on keyboard. This is no longer the case, a single click is all you will get now!
 - Updated our [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/ITS-HCD/nysds/blob/main/LICENSE.md). We now identify Lit.dev and Material icon licenses.
 - Our consoles were filled with warnings, NO LONGER! We fixed ALL browser warnings in Web Test Runner and lit-analyze tests.

[Robert Chen](https://github.com/novacat35), [Emily Gorelik](https://github.com/emilygorelik), and [Ben Greenberg](https://github.com/greenbergb) exterminated these bugs, cleared the console, and updated our license.

## Notable Figma changes
 - **Image component** - Decorative property added for accessibility.
 - **Screen template instructions** - Added detailed guidance for using the Screen Template component, including explanations of fidelity mode, and instructions on adjusting the size and theme.

[Leo Vogel](https://github.com/leo-vogel) and [Kristin Sorrentino](https://github.com/ksorrentino) made these changes.
