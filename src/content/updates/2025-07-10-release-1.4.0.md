## File uploads arrive
Say hello to `<nys-fileinput>`, a new component for handling file uploads in your forms. It supports multiple files, drag-and-drop, MIME type filtering, and more.

↳ Built by [Robert Chen](https://github.com/NovaCat35).  

## Package size cut in half
We streamlined dependencies across the library, shrinking the full `@nysds/components` package down to 380KB. That means faster installs and lighter apps.  
↳ Optimization work by [Eric Steinborn](https://github.com/esteinborn).  

## Fresh icons for your toolkit
Three new icons have landed in `<nys-icon>`:  

**print**
