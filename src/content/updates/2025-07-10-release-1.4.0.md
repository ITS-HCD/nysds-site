## ‚òÖ NYSDS v.1.4.0

The New York State Design System turns 1.4.0 today! We are releasing a new component this week: `<nys-fileinput>`! We optimized the NPM package build which cut the file size in half. The entire [@nysds](https://github.com/nysds)/components package is only 380KB now! We added three new icons, `print`, `progress_activity`, and `attach_file`. We also fixed a few bugs.

### üí† New Component
#### `<nys-fileinput>`
Allow users to upload files in your forms. Supports options such as accepting multiple files, drag-and-drop files, filtering by MIME types, and more. CODE ONLY. Figma still needs some work.

### üöÄ NPM package size cut in half
Node modules can introduce dependency-overload. We have optimized all dependencies for each component and the full package. File size is now 380KB uncompressed (91KB gzipped)!
