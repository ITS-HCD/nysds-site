# Getting Started with Excelsior

Excelsior is New York State’s shared design system—built to help agencies deliver digital experiences that are **user-friendly**, **accessible**, and **consistent**. Whether you're a designer, developer, or agency leader, Excelsior provides clear guidance and ready-to-use resources that let you work smarter while serving millions of New Yorkers.

## Why Excelsior?

Every day, New York State residents interact with digital services. They expect clear and accessible experiences. Without a unified approach, teams often create their own solutions—resulting in inconsistent designs, duplicated work, and accessibility challenges.

Excelsior solves this by providing:

- **Proven Best Practices:** From intuitive design to strict WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards, every element is created with residents in mind.
- **A Shared Language:** Our design and code libraries work side by side so that what you see in Figma is exactly what gets built.
- **Efficiency & Scalability:** Prebuilt components, design tokens, and guidelines accelerate development while keeping experiences consistent across all platforms.
